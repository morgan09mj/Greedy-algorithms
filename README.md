## hoarding
In a conversation with his friends in Bostan, Alex realized that dried fruit is going to be expensive.
So he took his basket and went to the grocery store. His son came to help him to buy the basket and take it home, but he doesn't want to cause his son trouble more than once. He should fill his basket with dried fruits in different ways so that he can spend the maximum possible amount of money by buying one basket and avoid the effect of inflation on the goods.
The seller tells him the price of products and inventory. You have to help Alex so that he can
Fill a basket while spending as much as possible.
Entrance :
In the first line, the number W (the maximum weight that the basket can hold) and then the number n
The products in the shop will be imported.
ci is entered as a non-negative integer, and in the second line, the number of available products, their corresponding cost
In the third line, the weight wi of a non-negative integer is entered. ) Note that ci is the total cost
is (wi
1≤ 𝑖 ≤𝑛
0 ≤ 𝑐𝑖, 𝑤𝑖 ≤ 10^4
Output:
The maximum amount of money that can be spent to fill the basket as a decimal output
It will be given .
